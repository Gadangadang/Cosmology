### Instructions for running code

Before running the scripts, there are a few python packages that are required. First make sure you have installed Matplotlib.pyplot and Numpy. This is either done through Anaconda, or by using Homebrew/Pip as shown below:
```
pip install numpy
brew install numpy
```

I use the following versions:
```
numpy 1.19.4  
matplotlib 3.3.3  
scipy 1.5.4 
```

Next, I added a loadbar, because it's somewhat amusing instead of a black screen in the terminal for 10 minutes. To install this, do 
```
pip install progress
